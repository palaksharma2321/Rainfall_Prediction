# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

Predicting rainfall accurately is a challenging task even for meteorological departments. This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to build a predictive model that determines whether it will rain today or not, based on various atmospheric features.

## 📖 About the Project

Rain prediction is typically dependent on expert meteorological analysis, but machine learning offers a scalable and automated alternative. In this project, we:
- Load and preprocess atmospheric data
- Handle missing and imbalanced data
- Perform feature selection and EDA
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models
- Predict whether it will rain today or not

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

We experimented with multiple classification models. Among them, **XGBoost** provided the highest accuracy due to its ability to handle nonlinear relationships and imbalanced data efficiently.

Steps included:
- Encoding categorical variables
- Balancing the dataset using SMOTE
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
